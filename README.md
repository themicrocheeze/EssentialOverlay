example nodecg/bundles/essential-score

## About:
essential-score is an ongoing project to graphic a production graphics package for tf2 that's free to use, open source, and when complete, be adapted to any hud.
Currently, most if not all production graphics packages for tftv are close source, RGL and KritzKast use a licensed hud and both have proprietary nodeCG packages, TeamfortressTV uses a proprietary hud and nodeCG packages, CappingTV as well. The Essentials.tf team created EssentialsHUD and CastingEssentials, 2 open source projects to make it easier to produce, with CastingEssentials being based on some older camera plugins and EssentialsHUD being a somewhat simple to use casting hud that anyone can use.

The problem is that while huds and plugins are nice, there are still a lot of limitations to what you can do presentation wise in-game for a casted match. That's where NodeCG comes in, NodeCG allows for easy use of production graphics by running them as webpages, allowing for production quality that a decade ago only a few organizations and groups on the internet would be able to do without having to pay a lot of money for industry and commercial grade software, The tf2 production community uses NodeCG to this day to run graphics. However, while NodeCG is open source, most production packages for tf2 are not. Thats why I created this projec.

A TF2 production package that anyone can use, clone, edit, share, maintain. Because finding people who know how or want to produce casts is already challenging enough, but finding people to create graphics packages is even harder.

## What's included:
# With the current version of essential-score you recive the following features:
* A scoreboard with the ability to customize the team names and colors on the scoreboard
* A roster lineup graphic allowing the end-user to easily showcase rosters(6v6 only)


## Plans for the future:
In future releases of essential-score I plan to include the following:
* A very simple lower third graphic
* The ability to add team logos and profile pictures
* Logs.tf integration allowing the producer to easily take logIDs from logs.tf and display them on screen
* Head 2 Head Graphics allowing to producer to show comparisions between individual players
* Info Boxes, allowing the producer to quickly display info on stream for users to see
* Animations for graphics to create a more Dynamic viewer experience
* Additional Customization Options to allow the production team to more easily tailor the bundle to their hud or needs.
* More detailed documentation so that anyone who wants to use or modify this project will be able to with ease.
